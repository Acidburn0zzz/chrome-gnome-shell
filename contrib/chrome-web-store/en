You MUST install native connector for this extension to work.

For Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu you can install package named "chrome-gnome-shell".

You also can install connector manually. See https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation for install instructions.
